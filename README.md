# WinGet Interactive

A simple interactive command line interface for the Windows Package Manager (`winget`).

## Disclaimer
I know almost nothing about coding and I made this just for fun in my free time. Actually, I got a lot of help from ChatGPT. I didn't test it extensively and there might be serious problems with it so use it at your own risk.

## Requirements
- Windows OS
- Windows Package Manager (`winget`) installed
- .NET runtime (if not using a compiled binary)

## Usage
Clone this repository, compile the code using a C# compiler, and run it (or download the exe form the releases).

## Contributing
I can't manage this project now but you're welcome to make your own fork and have fun with it.
